## Environmental home dataset tidying and exploration

Load in packages and datasets:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

enviro <- read.csv("C:/Users/ctaylor18/GitHub/GRLS_analyses/Data/house_details.csv")

location <- read.csv("C:/Users/ctaylor18/GitHub/GRLS_analyses/Data/location_history.csv")
```

NB. house details is UTD from Feb 2024 so could get a rerun of this more recently if needed for future years in study
